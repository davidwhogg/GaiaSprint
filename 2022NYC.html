<h2>2022 NYC Gaia DR3 Fête</h2><a id="2022"></a>

  <h3>Schedule and Location</h3>
  <p>The <b>2022 NYC Gaia DR3 Fête</b> will take place June 13–16 at the
      <a href="http://flatironinstitute.org/">Flatiron Institute</a>,
      a division of the <a href="https://simonsfoundation.org/">Simons
      Foundation</a>, in New York City.
  </p>

  <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
      The NYC Gaia DR3 fête will be a small in-person event (20-ish external
      participants) gathering in New York City (possibly with satellite events
      in other locations) starting on the release date of Gaia DR3 on 2022 June
      13 and ending mid-day on 2022 June 16. The idea of the event will be to
      make preliminary, science-inspired visualizations of the Gaia DR3 data and
      build new scientific collaborations, locally and globally.
      The main theme of this data release is <i>spectroscopy</i>, as
      <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-3">DR3 will
      provide entirely new kinds of data</a> (compared to past Gaia data
      releases) in the form of moderate-resolution spectra with a small
      wavelength range (the RVS spectra) and low-resolution spectra with wide
      wavelength coverage (the BP/RP spectra).</p>
    <p>
      <i>We recognize and apologize that this meeting conflicts with <a href="https://aas.org">AAS 240</a>.</i>
      We
      expect to be over-subscribed; if we are, we will give some preference to
      early-career applicants, and try to admit a set of participants that span
      a range of data applications.
    </p>

  <h3>Organizing Committee</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>David W Hogg</b> (NYU) (MPIA) (Flatiron)</li>
      <li><b>Adrian Price-Whelan</b> (Flatiron)</li>
      <li><b>Jackie Faherty</b> (AMNH)</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
    <p><i>In addition to a general <a href="codeofconduct.html">Code
    of Conduct</a>, we require participants to agree to a
    Collaboration Policy that ensures transparency and openness
    at the Sprints and associated meetings:</i></p>
    <p>All participants at every Gaia Sprint will be expected to openly
    share their ideas, expertise, code, and interim results.
    Project development will proceed out in the open, among
    participants and in the world.</p>
    <p>Participants will be encouraged to change gears, start new
    collaborations, and combine projects.  Any participant who
    contributes significantly to a project can expect
    co-authorship on resulting scientific papers, and any
    participant who gets significant contributions to a project
    is expected to include those contributors as co-authors.</p>
    <p>These rules make it <i>inadvisable to bring proprietary
    data sets or proprietary code</i> to any Sprint, unless the
    participant bringing such assets has the rights to open them
    or add collaborators.</p>
